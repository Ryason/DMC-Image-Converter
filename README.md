### Features I Would Like To Add
- Save and load previous conversions. As well as saving and loading of marked grid cells, to keep a users stitching progress.
- Bigger floss selection. Such as brands of floss other than DMC.
- Ability to see what the floss colours look like next to the selection panel.
- Track how long a user has been stitching a pattern, and estimate a completion date.
- Display what coloured floss is actually in the converted image, as the entire palette may not be used. Just because a colour has been selected, certain colours may never be matched to pixels in the users image.
- Track each colour floss and the amount required. With a display showing how many stitches of that colour are left to stitch in the image.
- Ability to save a converted iamage pattern to pdf in order to print it out.
- Update button that links to this project's repo, so users can get the latest version. (Could store version number in code and check against current release version number. Then alert if users exe is not the latest)
- Go public...
