# TO DO

- Process the users image
  * Allow the user to resize their image, and display how many stitches (pixels) the image will require
  * Analyse each pixel of the image, and determine the closet colour match of the selected DMC values
  * Store these matches so they can be recalled/displayed on a grid, that the user can use when stitching
  
- User interface
  * When the image is processed, display the matched DMC values in a grid that the user can pan around.
  * Make each stich in the grid selectable, allowing to highlight completed stitches (single click to highlight, double to remove highlight.
